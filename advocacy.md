**Accelerating the adoption of digital health, standards and interoperability**
FHIRLab offers a simulated functional health data environment. It helps demystify digital health standards and enables decision-makers and implementers to see how interoperability improves patient care, health system performance, and data-driven decision-making through real-world healthcare use cases and interactive walkthroughs. 

# Who can use FHIRLab for Advocacy?
- Policymakers and Health System Leaders
- Healthcare Workers
- Health IT Implementers and Developers
- Educators and Trainers in Digital Health
- Development Partners and Donors

# Use Cases
FHIRLab resoures make it easy to explore and understand the practical applications of Digital Health Standards and Interoperability. We have curated following examples of how different actors can use **FHIRLab** for advocacy, including the tools currently available in the sandbox.

## Understand foundtational cocnepts for standards
Learn foundational concepts of FHIR, and terminology, and why they matter.

**Resources**:
- **Ontoserver**: Learn basic terminology concepts, mappings and standard code usage (e.g. SNOMED, LOINC). Create your own ValueSets from local codes.
- **HAPI FHIR Server**: Learn about FHIR and explore basic resources using HAPI and understand how data is represented in FHIR. Create your first FHIR resource using UI or Postman.
- **AidBox**: Explore basic use of FHIR questinnaires and how local papers forms can be converted to FHIR questionnaire for Data Capturing and Exchange.

## Demonstrating Standards in Action
Showcase standards in action using real world healthcare examples through synthetic patient data.

**FHIRLab Resources**:
- **Bahmni/OpenMRS**: Explore pre-designed clinical workflows to understand how standardised structure data can be captured close to the point of care using terminologies and synthetic patient data.
- **Ontoserver**: Understand terminology concepts, mappings and standard code usage (e.g. SNOMED, LOINC).
- **OpenMRS Integration**: Explore how data Value Sets from a FHIR Terminology Server can be Integrated into a local EMR as interface terminology.

# Current Tools Available in FHIRLab

| Tool          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **HAPI FHIR Server** | Open-source FHIR R4 server to store and query clinical data. |
| **Ontoserver** | FHIR Terminology server with support for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and custom value sets. |
| **(Coming Soon) OpenMRS** | Integrated EMR environment to simulate structured data capture and transformation into FHIR. |
