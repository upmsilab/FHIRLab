# Problem Statement

Welcome to **Utopia**, a fictional country working to improve its digital health response following a recent infectious disease outbreak.

The existing paper intake form has led to **inconsistent and unstructured data collection** across facilities, making it difficult to aggregate, analyse, and respond effectively at the national level. Critical information is often **missing, misinterpreted, or delayed**, especially when shared between systems or regions.

As part of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s Clinical Informatics Group, your team has been tasked with transforming a **paper-based clinical intake form** into an electronic form that supports better data capture, sharing, and analysis during health emergencies.

To facilitate this, the Utopia Ministry of Health has also established a **national terminology server** to support the consistent use of clinical terminologies. This server includes access to the **SNOMED CT IPS Value Sets** and other national value sets to enable **semantic interoperability** across the health system.

## Your goal is to develop a standards-based electronic form that is:

- Machine-readable  
- Interoperable  
- Ready to be reused across facilities and systems  

You will use **FHIR** to model the form and ensure answers are coded using internationally recognised terminologies, such as **SNOMED CT** and **LOINC**, where applicable.

## Your Task

Each table represents a **clinical intformatics team**. Working together:

- Working together at each table, review the provided paper form (5 min). 
- Map questions to a corresponding FHIR Questionnaire item using the AidBox Form builder Chose the correct item type e.g., string, choice, date, Boolean etc. (15 min).
- Review and identify value sets for each form fields where answer could be a discrete list or predefined options e.g., Yes/No, Gender, Problems history. List of available value sets is provided (15 min). 
- Discuss your work among the group (5 min). 
- Download a sample FHIR Questionnaire JSON file to review: https://tinyurl.com/274kd7nn

 **Note:** If you don't have access to laptop, continue with the provided mapping sheet:

- **Form Field Name** (already printed)  
- **FHIR Questionnaire Type**  
- **Answer Value Set** from the **SNOMED CT  IPS Set** (if applicable)  

ðŸ“Ž Use the *Supporting Information* below for guidance on FHIR types and sample value sets.
