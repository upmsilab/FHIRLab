title: FHIR® Lab
description: "<mark>Digital Health Interoperability Sandbox for learning and capacity development.</mark><br><br>
FHIR® Lab is an interoperability sandbox, with a collection of tools designed for low-resource settings as a safe, and practical environment where users can develop skills, test big ideas in digital health, and accelerate the adoption of standards such as, HL7® FHIR®, SNOMED CT, ICD, LOINC etc. Whether you're a policymaker, implementer, developer, student or trainer, FHIR Lab can support advocacy, hands-on learning, and real-world testing before any major investments and scaling national systems. You can call it a playpen or a launchpad for digital health transformations, suited for local needs, and aligned with global best practices.<br><br>
The FHIR® Lab sandbox is part of The Strengthening Standards Capability Project (SSCP), co-funded by CSIRO Australia and Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade <br><br>
HL7® and FHIR® are registered trademarks of Health Level Seven International.<br><br>
Please find below a complete list of tools available in FHIRLab to support learning, testing, and advocacy efforts."
